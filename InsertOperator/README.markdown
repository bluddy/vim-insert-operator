insert-operator.vim
===================

I often find myself adding letters at the end of a word. I want to be able to repeat this with '.' (period), but it's not possible because you have to use 'ea' and 'e' is a movement so it doesn't get repeated by '.'.

This plugin adds 2 operators, gI and gA, which also take a motion such as e,w,$,p,i) etc. They can be repeated with '.'
